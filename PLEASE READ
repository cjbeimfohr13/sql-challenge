while working on the homework I was hvaing issues with my query tools and decided to restart the program then restart my computer that wasnt working so I uninstalled pgadmin to then reinstall it to hopefully fix the problem, but now it isnt allowing me back on pgadmin. In the important file it is a majority of the work I had completed but have a meeting with my tutor this afternoon and hopefully will be able to fix the problem and submit everything properly! I am sorry for the inconvenience.
